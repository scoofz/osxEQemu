# Make the game's sound FOLLOW the macOS default output (Bluetooth headphones dying
# mid-game, switching outputs) instead of staying pinned to the device that was the
# default when the game started.
#
# Why: Wine's CoreAudio driver opens each stream on a HALOutput audio unit pinned to
# one device. When that device vanishes (headphones out of battery), the game's audio
# ends up on the Mac speakers ignoring their volume/mute, and only a game restart
# recovers it. engine/patches/coreaudio-follow-default.py makes streams opened on the
# default device use macOS's DefaultOutput unit, which tracks the default itself.
# Details and the OSXEQL_PIN_AUDIO_DEVICE=1 escape hatch: see that file.
#
# Rebuilds ONLY winecoreaudio.so (see engine/driverlib.sh) and swaps it into the runtime(s), keeping a backup.
#
#   engine/audiofix.sh            patch the runtime(s)
#   engine/audiofix.sh --revert   restore the original winecoreaudio.so
#   engine/audiofix.sh --status   show whether each runtime is patched
